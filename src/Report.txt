1. Author/email address

	Mustakimur Rahman Khandaker (mrk15e@my.fsu.edu)
	Yongjiang Liang (yl14u@my.fsu.edu)

2. How to compile the code

    platform: linux
    just type "make"


3. Commands supported in stations/routers/bridges

   3.1 stations:

	   send <destination> <message> // send message to a destination host
	   show arp 		// show the ARP cache table information
	   show pq 		// show the pending_queue
	   show	host 		// show the IP/name mapping table
	   show	iface 		// show the interface information
	   show	rtable 		// show the contents of routing table
	   quit // close the station

   3.2 routers:

	   show	arp 		// show the ARP cache table information
	   show	pq 		// show the pending_queue
	   show	host 		// show the IP/name mapping table
	   show	iface 		// show the interface information
	   show	rtable 		// show the contents of routing table
	   quit // close the router


   3.3 bridges:

	   show sl 		// show the contents of self-learning table
	   quit // close the bridge


4. To start the emulation, run

   	run_simulation

   , which emulates the following network topology

   
          B              C                D
          |              |                |
         cs1-----R1------cs2------R2-----cs3
          |              |                |
          -------A--------                E

    cs1, cs2, and cs3 are bridges.
    R1 and R2 are routers.
    A to E are hosts/stations.
    Note that A is multi-homed, but it is not a router.


5. Difficulties that we have encountered during the development of the project

	1) we are not quite sure how to forward ip packet hop by hop, 
	   then we run the DEMO many times to figure out how one packet go from one hop to another;
	2) continuously use inet_ntoa will print out same ip address, then we decide use inet_ntop;
	3) it's not easier to convert structures to byte array, also hard to extract structures from byte array,
	   then we design ByteIO/DataIO classes for byte array extraction;
	4) we are now familiar with ARP, so we have to check the printout of DEMO to learn more about it;

6. A LOG of the progress we make from time to time
	
	1) Add server model into bridge.cpp, add client model into station.cpp; 
	   Use select() funciton for I/O multiplexing;
	2) Add self learning into bridge, design ByteIO/DataIO classes for byte arry extraction;
	3) Add send/forward IP packets into bridge, and forward IP packets into router;
	4) Add ARP protocol into bridge/router;
	5) Add timeout to check cache into bridge/router/station;
	6) Add commands to show information on bridge/router/station;


7. Assumptions
	1) The maximum length of one message is 1000.
	2) The TTL for cache is 15 seconds.
